Seasonal Produce Management System

This project demonstrates a simple C++ implementation of a produce management system, emphasizing modularity, inheritance, and operator overloading. The code is designed for educational purposes, aligned with the SYDE 121 curriculum.

## Features
- Base `Produce` class with derived classes for seasonal produce (`WinterProduce`, `SpringProduce`, etc.).
- Constructors, equality operators, and print methods.
- Modular structure for easy expansion.

## Prerequisites
- C++17 or later.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
